Pygments-SASS
============

[Pygments](http://pygments.org): a Python-based code highlighting tool, comes with a set of builtin styles_ (not css files) for code highlighting. You have to generate a CSS file using the command line. I just figured I'd save someone this work in the future and generate all the CSS files based on the Pygments builtins.
